  - it is usually hardcoded callbacks.

  - it is fixable by splitting those files into 2 files: one for 4D Studio, one for four.js
  - there are 3 occurences
    - TODO put the list here
  - estimation: one or two days
- later tasks:
  - remove code duplication and unify the code between mobile and 4d studio e.g. 2 viewers atm
  - write automatized tests
  - generate api documentation with jsdoc
