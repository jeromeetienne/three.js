### Notes about the transition to three.js r71
- we got a pull request for three.js r71
- lets fix conflicts with master if any
- once merge we can start working on binary models
- to use the three.js format json+binary
  - PRO it is standard three.js format
  - PRO will reduce the bandwidth (estimated to -30%)
  - PRO will reduce the ram needed when parsing (so lot less garbarge collection)
  - reduce tab crash due to ram
- there is early work in branch XXXX
  - TODO where is the branch for that
