# How to release
- release are done in the same principle as three.js
- we apply semver system http://semver.org/
- we add a git-tag for the release
- thus it is downloadable from github as .zip or you can use git clone to checkout the version you prefere.
- release should likely be done periodically, it is easier to handle
  - period to be determined later
